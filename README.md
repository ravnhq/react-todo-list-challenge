# react-todo-list-challenge

Steps
- Fork this repo to your account

- Create a TODO list Vanilla JS project

### Criterias
- Validate form fields (inputs, textareas, checkboxes, buttons)
- Persist errors/form values in local storage
- Reset/clear local storage

## The Solution

- All data is being stored locally with (localStorage)
- I am using water.css to improve the base HTML elements styles
- Code is done using typescript 
- DOM rendering is done using merely DOM API
- In case a new compilation is needed, run "tsc" in the root folder so it includes all settings from tsconfig.json
